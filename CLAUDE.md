This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a blockchain-based intelligent security platform (区块链智能安防平台) demonstration prototype. The project combines AI-based threat detection with blockchain multi-signature decision making and audit capabilities. The system demonstrates the complete flow from threat detection to decentralized decision-making and trusted logging.

**Key Components:**
- AI threat detection using an `Ensemble_Hybrid` model trained on CIC-IDS2017 dataset
- Private blockchain network with 3+ Geth nodes using PoA (Clique) consensus
- Multi-signature proposal system for response decisions
- Simulated security response execution and audit logging

## Project Architecture

### Core Assets (Ready-to-Use)
- `training.ipynb` - Complete model training code and architecture details
- `model.pth`, `scaler.pkl`, `feature_selector.pkl`, `label_encoder.pkl` - Trained model deployment package
- `抽样数据脚本.ipynb` - Script for extracting real attack samples from CIC-IDS2017
- `inference_data.pt` - Pre-generated attack simulation data
- `selected_features.json`, `model_info.json` - Model metadata

```

### System Roles & Accounts
- **System Treasury Account**: High-balance account (1000 ETH) for incentive payments
- **PoA Signer Accounts**: Node-specific accounts for consensus and block production
- **Manager Business Accounts**: Decision-maker accounts for proposal signing (can be same as PoA accounts)
- **Operator**: Front-line users who monitor alerts and manually create proposals for medium-confidence threats
- **Manager**: Senior decision-makers who review and sign proposals

### Core Workflow
1. **Threat Detection**: AI model processes network data and assigns confidence scores
2. **Tiered Response**:
   - High confidence (>0.90): Automatic response
   - Medium-high (0.80-0.90): Automatic proposal creation
   - Medium-low (0.70-0.80): Alert for manual operator decision
   - Low (<0.70): Silent logging
3. **Multi-sig Process**: Proposals require 2/3 Manager signatures for approval
4. **Incentive System**: Final signer receives 0.01 ETH from treasury
5. **Execution Simulation**: Security actions logged in database (no real firewall interaction)

## AI Model Details

The project uses an `Ensemble_Hybrid` PyTorch model with the following architecture:
- **Input**: 64 selected features from network traffic data
- **Components**: Deep branch, Wide branch, Residual blocks, Self-attention, Feature interaction
- **Output**: 12 threat categories (including "Rare_Attack" for uncommon threats)
- **Performance**: 99.6+ % accuracy on CIC-IDS2017 test set

## Development Commands

**Backend Development (Phase 2 Complete):**
```bash
# Start Ganache (prerequisite)
npm run start-chain      # Ganache CLI with fixed mnemonic

# Start FastAPI Backend
python3 -m uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
# Backend runs on http://localhost:8000

# Test Complete System
./test_phase2_fixed.sh   # Comprehensive Phase 2 testing
```

**API Endpoints (All Functional):**
```bash
POST /api/attack/simulate        # AI threat detection simulation
GET  /api/system/status         # System health and account balances
GET  /api/proposals             # Multi-sig proposal management
POST /api/proposals/{id}/sign   # Manager proposal signing
GET  /api/logs/detections      # Threat detection audit trail
GET  /api/logs/executions      # Response execution logs
POST /api/test/reward          # Test reward sending function
```

**Blockchain Environment:**
- Ganache CLI with fixed mnemonic: `bulk tonight audit hover toddler orange boost twenty biology flower govern soldier`
- Deterministic accounts: Manager_0-2 (indices 0-2), Treasury (index 3) 
- Network: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`, 5-second block time
- Alternative: Ganache Desktop with same mnemonic

**Project Status:**
- ✅ Phase 1: Environment and configuration complete
- ✅ Phase 2: Backend development complete and tested
- ✅ AI model integration with real preprocessors (joblib-based)
- ✅ Multi-signature proposal system with ETH rewards
- ✅ Complete threat detection → decision → execution → audit workflow
- 🔄 Phase 3: Frontend development (next phase)

## Technical Implementation Details

**Account Management:**
- Fixed mnemonic ensures deterministic account addresses across restarts
- Manager accounts (0-2) used for multi-signature proposal approval (2/3 threshold)
- Treasury account (3) pays 0.01 ETH incentive to final proposal signer
- Web3 integration handles all blockchain interactions via local Ganache

**API Structure (Phase 2 Complete):**
- **AI Integration**: Real Ensemble_Hybrid model with joblib-compatible preprocessors
- **Database**: SQLite with ThreatDetectionLog, Proposal, ExecutionLog models
- **Blockchain**: Web3.py integration with Ganache, multi-sig proposals, ETH rewards
- **Services**: ThreatDetectionService, ProposalService, SystemInfoService
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with real attack simulation

**Threat Detection Confidence Levels:**
- `>0.90`: Automatic response + execution logging
- `0.80-0.90`: Auto-create proposal for Manager approval
- `0.70-0.80`: Alert only, manual proposal creation by Operator
- `<0.70`: Silent background logging

## Development Guidelines

- **No Model Training**: Use existing trained model files; all simulation uses pre-generated data
- **Security Focus**: This is a defensive security platform - all features should enhance security monitoring and response
- **Simulation-Based**: No real firewall/network device interaction; all responses are simulated and logged
- **Demonstration-Oriented**: UI should clearly visualize the threat detection → decision → response → audit flow
- **Role-Based Access**: Frontend should support switching between Operator and Manager views
